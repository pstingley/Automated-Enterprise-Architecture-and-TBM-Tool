Automated Enterprise Architecture and TBM Migration Tool

The Python program was written to be extremely simple for those who don't know
Python.  It cleans, sorts and counts the applications identified by any inventory
tool capable of providing a product's name followed by its version.

The python program is named The_Mill.py because a user simply runs the data
through the mill and out comes a data file that they can paste into the provided
spreadsheet.

It only takes a few minutes to run the program and paste it into the spreadsheet.

So long and thanks for all the fish!
